Self-attention layers are used as the encoder with an MLP classifier with two fully-connected layers with ReLU activation function, and the CYK algorithm is used in the decoder that generates the tree with the maximum score using the scores obtained from the encoder. The model is trained on a merged English, German and French UCCA dataset. The features (PoS tag, dependency label) are extracted by Stana library and used in the input layer of the model.",
